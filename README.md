# ReactFlux Ansible role

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [ReactFlux](https://github.com/electh/ReactFlux) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

Check [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) for the full list of supported options. Refer to [this page](docs/configuring-reactflux.md) for details about setting up the service with this role.

💡 For an Ansible playbook which integrates this role and makes it easier to use, see the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

## Development

### pre-commit

You can optionally install a Git pre-commit hook (via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) + [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)) that runs formatting and linting checks before each commit. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

To install the hook, run the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command below:

```sh
just prek-install-git-pre-commit-hook
```

### Molecule

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

Refer to [this page](./molecule/README.md) for details about how to utilize it.

### Releases

Releases are tagged automatically. On every push to `main`, [`.github/workflows/autotag.yml`](./.github/workflows/autotag.yml) runs [`bin/compute-next-tag.sh`](./bin/compute-next-tag.sh), which derives the tag from `defaults/main.yml` and from the tags that already exist — never from commit messages, so the result does not depend on the order in which pull requests get merged. A commit that only touches documentation, CI configuration or the Molecule tests is not released.

Tags look like `v<version>-<release>`. ReactFlux publishes no versions of its own (see the comment on `reactflux_version` in [`defaults/main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml)), so the version component is the placeholder `2025.6.2` this repository has used since June 2025, and the release counter carries all of the information. Pinning a real version in `defaults/main.yml` would start a `v<that version>-N` series with no change to the script.

[`bin/test-compute-next-tag.sh`](./bin/test-compute-next-tag.sh) exercises that script against throwaway repositories, and runs as a prek hook whenever it, the script, or `defaults/main.yml` changes.
